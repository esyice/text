Ezice Text is a lightweight, web-based tool that allows users to **share text instantly across multiple operating systems and devices**—without needing to install any app or browser extension.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔐 No login or signup required
- 📱 Cross-platform support (Android, iOS, Windows, macOS, Linux)
- ⚡ Fast and simple user interface
- 💾 LocalStorage-based storage (secure and private)
- 📤 Share text using a randomly generated alphanumeric code
- ♻️ One-time or temporary use — no backend, no permanent traces

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. User types or pastes text into the input box.
2. A unique alphanumeric code is generated.
3. The same code can be entered on another device to retrieve the text.
4. All text is stored **locally** on the device — not on a remote server.
